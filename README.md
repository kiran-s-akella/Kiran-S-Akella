# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Kiran!

I enjoy working on digital system design, Microprocessors, Analog electronics, VLSI, and am passionate about building cool hardware and software projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Digital electronics and Verilog.  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Microprocessors and Analog integrated circuits.  
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Verilog projects and RISC V processors.

- âš¡ **Fun fact:** The first microprocessor, Intel 4004, had only 2,300 transistors â€” todayâ€™s processors have over 100 billion! To put it in perspective, you could fit the entire Intel 4004 die inside the space of a single transistor on a modern chip like Apple's M1 or AMD's Ryzen!
